#=====================Introduction===============#

The thesis aims to model recall-based data, recognizing that the probability of recall decreases as the time between monitoring and the event increases. 
It proposes a mathematical model based on the functional form of recall probability as a function of elapsed time.

#===================Summary of Chapters===========#

Chapter 1 covers concepts related to time-to-event data, competing risks, and computational techniques for estimation. 
Chapter 2 focuses on parametric models for recall-based data, utilizing the Weibull distribution for time to event. 
Chapter 3 generalizes the recall-based studies to the competing risks setup, considering exponentially distributed time to event. 
Chapter 4 extends the recall-based problem under competing risk scenarios, incorporating different shapes and scales for the Weibull distribution. 
Chapter 5 explores scenarios where latent time to events associated with different causes follows different distributions.
